add children into currItem DIRECTLY in COMP_MENU/ROLE
    - IMPORTANT -> NOW WE ARE CALLING THE API TO GET EACH OF THE PERSONS ROLES. 
    WE SHOULD MAKE THE API RETURN ALL OF THE CURRENT EMPLOYEES WITH THE ROLES INSIDE THE RESPONSE OBJECT WHICH WILL HELP US  

FIGURE OUT EMPLOYEEE SHIT, SHOULDNT BE TAHT HARD
    -MAKE IT SO THE ROLESELECTOR CAN HAVE CURRENT ROLES THAT ARE ALREADY ASSIGNED
      JUST AS NORMALLY BE ABLE TO MODIFY THOSE ROLES AND ON SAVE THAT THOSE APPLY
    -FIGURE OUT FIRING AN EMPLOYEE,
        -THIS MEANS THAT WE ACTUALLY DELETE THE ENTRIES IN THE DATABASE TOO OF THE COMPANY_EMPLOYEE_ROLE, AND COMPANY_EMPLOYEE TOO.
          SO WE COMPELETELY REMOVE THEM FROM THE COMPANY
    -FIGURE OUT OTHER ATTRIBUTES LIKE TERMINATION DATE IN THE COMPANY_EMPLOYEE_ROLE TABLE,
    -FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THE EXACT SAME THING WITH THE EMPLOYEE TAB AS WE DID WITH THE MANAGEEMENU TAB AND ROLES TAB DIRECT STATE UPDATES
      (WHICH WILL PROBABLY MEAN GET ALL THE NECESSARY DATA DIRECTLY INTO THE EMPLOYEE OBJECTS)

MAYBE FILTER FOR COMPLETED ORDERS STILL
    COMPLICATIONS:
        -FETCH ORDERS JUST FROM THIS DAY???
        -FETCH ALL ORDERS AND FILTER THEM LATER???
            THIS WOULD MEAN WE WOULD HAVE TO REFETCH ON CHANGE OF THE DATE
        -CANNOT CHANGE THE DATE TO THE FUTURE DEFINETLY.
